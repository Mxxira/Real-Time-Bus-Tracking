# Real-Time-Bus-Tracking
-This is an example of the real time bus tracking activity we completed in the MIT bootcamp in 2022.
-In this assignment, I learned more about arrays and the numerical system of coding, more than I had known before. This assignment specifically I had a hard time getting done, but was able to figure out my mistakes in the end. All in all, this assignemnt helped me grow a lot as a programmer and taught me necessary skills that I can use for future projects. Thank you!
